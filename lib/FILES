More suggestions are welcome.

lib:
Generic libraries and C runtime sources should be here.

lib/libc:
C Library and C runtime routines should go there.

lib/libc/arch:
Architecture-dependent stuff of C Runtime.  Mainly crt0.S and system call
wrappers.

ARM-specific notes:
As of GCC 5.1 the C compiler will emit a call to __aeabi_idivmod or something
alike to do division on software since ARM does not include hardware division.
The corresponding functions should be inside lib/libc/arch/arm.

One can see how GCC mess with division or modulo by printing out the assembly:

gcc -S -o test.o test.c

lib/libc/stdio:
lib/libc/stdlib:
lib/libc/string:
...
C standard functions (sprintf(3), memset(3) etc.) should go there.
