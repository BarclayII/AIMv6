More suggestions are welcome.

lib:
Generic libraries and C runtime sources should be here.

lib/libc:
C Library and C runtime routines should go there.

lib/libc/arch:
Architecture-dependent stuff of C Runtime.  Mainly crt0.S and system call
wrappers.

lib/libc/stdio:
lib/libc/stdlib:
lib/libc/string:
...
C standard functions (sprintf(3), memset(3) etc.) should go there.
