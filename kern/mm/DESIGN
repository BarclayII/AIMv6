I enabled incontiguous physical page allocation to solve fragmentation
problems.  An alloc_pages() call may return a list of pages which may
be incontiguous (for example, returning a list with PFN 1, 3, 5, 6, 7).
Not sure whether it's a good design...

For virtual memory allocators I implemented a simple SLAB allocator
(currently in xv6-Loongson3a).
