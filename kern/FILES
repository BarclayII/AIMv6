More suggestions are welcome.

kern:
All kernel-related sources and headers should be here.

kern/arch/$(ARCH):
Architecture dependent sources, including trap handling, context switches, etc.
should go there.

kern/arch/$(ARCH)/$(MACH):
For machine dependent sources.

kern/arch/$(ARCH)/include/asm:
For architecture-dependent headers.

kern/arch/$(ARCH)/include/asm/mach-$(MACH):
For machine-dependent headers.

kern/include:
Kernel-specific headers should go there.  Module-specific sub-directories are
recommended.
Architecture-dependent headers should go inside kern/arch/$(ARCH)/include/asm
rather than kern/include.

kern/arch/$(ARCH)/mm, kern/mm:
Memory management, including memory allocators, both physical and virtual.

The physical memory allocator should expose the following structure:

	struct page
		For physical page representation

and the following interfaces:

	alloc_pages(int num)
		Allocate @num pages.
	free_pages(struct page *p, int num)
		Free @num pages starting from @p.

The virtual memory allocator should expose the following interfaces:

	kmalloc(size_t size)
		Allocate @size bytes.
	kfree(void *ptr)
		Free an allocation including @ptr.

and can optionally include kernel equivalents of calloc(3) and realloc(3).

See kern/mm/DESIGN for my (BarclayII's) current design of memory allocators.

The memory management module should expose the following structure:

	struct mm_struct
		A per-process structure containing memory mapping etc.

kern/arch/$(ARCH)/sched, kern/sched:
Scheduler-related sources, including process (and thread, if any) management,
should go there.

kern/sync:
Synchronization-related sources (spinlocks, semaphores etc.) should go there.
