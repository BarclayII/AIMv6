/*
 * Loongson 3A starts up by executing PMON in the programmable ROM.
 *
 * PMON works in 32-bit, and so does MBR.
 * Therefore things like "unsigned long long" should not appear in bootloader
 * code.
 *
 * PMON originally does not support MBR bootloader code, so I modified PMON
 * code to provide some help for MBR.  I found that a bootloader doing all
 * works on its own is unrealistic for MIPS:  I turned on size optimization to
 * save as much space as possible, skipped ELF verifications, introduced three
 * helper functions as well as the handle for reading the hard disk, fixed MBR
 * to load kernel from the second partition, skipped partition type
 * verification, and still nearly ran out of 446-byte space.
 *
 * The modified PMON passes four arguments to MBR:
 * @fd:       file descriptor representing the hard disk.
 * @findsect: function to jump to the specified sector.
 * @read:     read from the file descriptor, similar to read(2)
 * @lseek:    reposition read offset, similar to lseek(2)
