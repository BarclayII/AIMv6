# A Brief Documentation of PMON, the PROM Monitor

PROM (Programmable Read-Only Memory) Monitor is an open source boot environment
solution for MIPS machines.  It is simpler than traditional BIOS on IBM-
compatible PC, but it also does the job of a bootloader (like GRUB).

### Command-Line Interface

PMON would hint for a key press with the following message:

	Press any other key to abort.

Hitting a key other than ENTER would bring up the command line interface.

Enter `h` for help, `h <command>` for description of given command.

A preferred method of testing one's bootloader and kernel is booting via TFTP,
which is covered in next section.

Although our ultimate goal is to burn the BIOS and to produce a standalone
self-bootable machine, it is *NOT* recommended to test one's bootloader by
directly burning the ROM because PMON has a lot of excellent builtin abilities
such as:
  1. TLB, cache, and serial console initialization.
  2. Exception handling.
  3. Preliminary debugging.
  4. Network interface (hard to implement from scratch).

A preferred method for experimenting one's own bootloader is to remotely load
the bootloader image into RAM via TFTP, which is covered in the following
sections.

### Network configuration

(TODO: add tutorial for configuring network by `ifaddr`, `ping` and other
commands)

### Booting via TFTP

(TODO: add TFTP setup, `load` command and steps for loading bootloader or
kernel image into RAM)

### Burning BIOS

(TODO: add `load` command and steps for burning into ROM)
