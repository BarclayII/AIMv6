# Lab 0: Prerequisites

Designing an operating system certainly involves an *awful* amount of work.

Before you take this experiments, you must prepare for:

1. Reading a LOT of documentations, specifications, technical manuals, and
   anything else you can or can't imagine.  Some of them are detailed and
   self-evident, while others are poorly-written.  We will provide as much
   resource as we can.
2. Reading and struggling to understand a LOT of code.  We are
   ~~evil~~ kind enough to provide a skeleton code for you to work with.
3. Doing a LOT of (re)searches, and asking MANY questions.
4. Doing, and *failing* a LOT of experiments.
5. (for those unluckies working on ARM/MIPS) Working WITHOUT A DEBUGGER.

As a side note: teamwork absolutely helps.

You may encounter mistakes, or bugs in our code or documentations as you move
on.  *Do not hesitate to report to us*.  Reporting bugs could be in any form,
from GitHub issues to emails.

If you're new to Unix-like systems, you could ramp up by checking out
the documentations in `unix` folder.  The documentations there may provide
a starting point.

Take a deep breath, and get yourself ready for your very first documentation.

### Setup

To do your operating system experiments you need the following:

1. A working Linux.
  * BSD or other Unix-like systems are OK if you can install GNU Compiler
    Collection (GCC).
  * For those who work on ARM, GNU-M4 is also needed. We'll explain later.
2. A cross-compiler suite.
  * Currently GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) is the only compiler suite
    we're supporting.  Preferably, it should be the latest version, but
    our code supports all toolchains mentioned in the root README document.
  * If you insist on using other compiler suites such as
    CLang/LLVM, you're welcome to contribute to our repository.
3. A decent editor.
  * `vim(1)`, `emacs(1)`, `nano(1)`, ~~`ed(1)`~~ are all good choices.  You
    can also use IDEs as you wish.
4. Other tools, software and hardware.
  * ARM developers: make sure you have:
    + A working SD or SDHC card. SDXC will fallback to SDHC's behavior but is
      acceptable. Zedboard should have an SDHC included.
    + A USB wire. The ones you charge your android phone are just ok. You may
      need an extra wire if you want to try Vivado.
  * MIPS developers: make sure you have:
    + A serial-to-USB converter.
    + A SATA-to-USB converter.

### ISA and ABI

*Instruction Set Architecture* includes data types, registers,
instructions, addressing modes, interrupt and exception handling, and
everything else one must understand for **writing programs in assemblies**.

*Application Binary Interface* includes the specifications and conventions
of register usage, function calls, stacks, and everything else one must
understand for **writing programs in assemblies and C together**.

Ramping up an ISA and an ABI involves heavy reading.  Prepare yourself to
read long, boring, potentially poorly-documented manuals.

Here are some warmups, however:

For ARM developers:
* Go directly to ARM infocenter (http://infocenter.arm.com/) and you should get
  ALL the documents.
* ARM has different ABIs and we use EABI. If you see GNUEABI, that's the
  same thing.
* ARM's ISA has *A LOT OF VERSIONS* and there are optional features.
  Unfortunately integer division is one of them, and our core does not have it
  implemented.
* Remember, our processor core is Cortex-A9, which uses ARMv7A.

For MIPS developers:
* There's an excellent book named *See MIPS Run* which provides an in-depth
  tour to the MIPS architecture, the way MIPS assemblies interact with C
  programs, and the way Linux works on MIPS.  We didn't include the book
  in our repository to avoid copyright issues, but you can probably find
  the electronic version on Internet.
* Or you can get a first impression in `mips64-loongson3a/prereq.markdown`.
