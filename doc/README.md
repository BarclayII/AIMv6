## Documentations

Documentations inside the `doc` directory mainly accepts these formats:

1. Text files (usually `*.txt`).
2. GitHub-flavored Markdown files (`*.md`).  They are basically enhanced text
files and are readable both under text viewers and GitHub.
3. PDFs.  Documentations written in TeX are highly recommended to be compiled
to PDFs.

For lab users, move on to `labs/lab0-prerequisites.markdown` for introduction.

For challengers, there's a `challenge` folder listing all challenges we could
think of.  These challenges are about techniques, algorithms and ideas used
in real world.

(TODO: add documentation folder descriptions)
