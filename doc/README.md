## Documentations

Documentations inside the `doc` directory mainly accepts these formats:

1. Text files (usually `*.txt`).
2. GitHub-flavored Markdown files (`*.md`).  They are basically enhanced text
files and are readable both under text viewers and GitHub.
3. PDFs.  Documentations written in TeX are highly recommended to be compiled
to PDFs.

We assume that the users are familiar with Linux shell commands and programs
in most documentations.  Those who are new to Linux or Unix-like systems
are recommended to read the documentations under `unix` directory first.

(TODO: add documentation folder descriptions)
