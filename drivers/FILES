More suggestions are welcome.
I didn't think thoroughly of how to separate between early immediate accesses
(like loading file from disk during booting) and late device configurations
(like initializing devfs).  Besides, xv6 on i386 seems to interact with UART
via inb() and outb(), so I'm not sure whether we should wrap memory-mapped
hardware register accesses into functions to maintain compatibility.
The following is only a possible organization.

drivers:
For driver-specific stuff.

The following drivers probably should be prioritized:
  1.  UART driver
  2.  AHCI driver (for controlling SATA)
  3.  SD driver (?) (for Zedboard)

drivers/ata:
ATA (including SATA) driver source codes.

drivers/include:
Headers for drivers.

drivers/sd:
Driver source codes for SD cards (?)

drivers/serial:
Driver source codes for serial console, e.g. UART.
