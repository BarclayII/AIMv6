More suggestions are welcome.

bios:
This is the place for holding all pre-bootloader sources.
A separate Makefile target is expected for building them.

bios/arch/$(ARCH):
For architecture-dependent stuff, including arm, mips64, i386 (if any).

bios/arch/$(ARCH)/$(MACH):
Machine-dependent sources should go there.

bios/include:
For pre-bootloader architecture-independent headers.

bios/arch/$(ARCH)/include/asm:
Pre-bootloader architecture-dependent machine-independent headers should
go there.

bios/arch/$(ARCH)/include/asm/mach-$(MACH):
Machine-dependent headers should go there.
