More suggestions are welcome.

boot:
This is the place for holding all bootloader-related sources.
A separate Makefile is expected for building the bootloader.

boot/arch/$(ARCH):
For architecture-dependent stuff, including arm, mips64, i386 (if any).

boot/arch/$(ARCH)/$(MACH):
Machine-dependent sources should go there.

boot/include:
For bootloader-specific architecture-independent headers.

boot/arch/$(ARCH)/include/asm:
Bootloader-specific architecture-dependent machine-independent headers should
go there.

boot/arch/$(ARCH)/include/asm/mach-$(MACH):
Machine-dependent headers should go there.
